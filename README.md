# NewerSMBW-Modding
This repo is for me to put all the stuff I've made for NewerSMBW. It'll mainly consist of bugfixes, improvements, and some new features. If you
find any issues or bugs (with the content here, not NewerSMBW bugs), report them in the Issues tab.

The code hacks for this project were made with the `cw` branch of [NewerSMBW's GitHub][newerGit], and are intended to be used with v1.3.0
of the mod, however certain features may work in other versions, or in other non-Newer mods such as [NSMBWer+][nsmbwer]. If this is the case, it will
be mentioned in that feature's readme.

> [!NOTE]
> Do NOT ask me to port any code hacks to older versions of NewerSMBW.

## Full List of Features
- [Improved Level Nodes](/Improved-Level-Nodes): Color animations and fixed rotation for Newer's level nodes!

## Crediting and Usage
If you want to use anything from this for your own projects, be sure to credit me for it (credit me as `MandyIGuess`).

Each released feature can either be gotten by downloading the entire repo (`Code -> Download ZIP`), or by finding the latest release of it in the Releases tab.

Installation instructions can be found in the readme file in each folder.
