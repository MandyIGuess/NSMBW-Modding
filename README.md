# NewerSMBW-Modding
This repo is for me to put all the stuff I've made for NewerSMBW/NSMBWer+. It'll mainly consist of bugfixes, improvements, and some new
features. If you find any issues or bugs (with the content here, not NewerSMBW bugs), report them in the Issues tab.

The code hacks in this repo were made with the `cw` branch of [NewerSMBW's GitHub][newer], and are intended to be used with v1.3.0 of the mod,
however some features may work in other versions, or in other non-Newer mods such as [NSMBWer+][nsmbwer]. If this is the case, it will be mentioned in
that feature's readme.

Don't ask me to port any code hacks to older versions of NewerSMBW. Most hacks are simple enough that anyone should be able to adapt it.
